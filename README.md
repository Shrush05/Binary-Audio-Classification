## Problem Statement
Many accident victims wait for help at the site, and a delay costs them their lives. The reasons could range from ambulances/fire brigade stuck in traffic and not being able to reach the site on time due to traffic jams. 

The solution is to create a system that automatically detects the emergency vehicle prior to reaching the traffic signals and notifies.
